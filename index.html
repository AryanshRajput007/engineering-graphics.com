      <p>ANS. Isometric drawing refers to a 2D representation of a 3D object using parallel lines to convey depth, without any distortion or foreshortening. It is a simplified representation of an object, typically drawn on isometric graph paper. On the other hand, isometric projection is a method of visually representing a 3D object in a 2D space, using parallel lines that are not necessarily perpendicular to the viewing plane.

The representative factor, also known as the scale factor or scale ratio, is a numerical value that represents the relationship between the dimensions of an object in a drawing and its actual size in real life. It is used to indicate how much the drawing has been scaled down or up compared to the actual object.
